/**
 * Create an async operation that will be canceled whenever its dependencies

 *
 * @see usePromise for the case when your component receives a promise it does
 * not initiate.
 *
 * @param op The async function to run. This is given an abort signal which will
 * be triggered if the `deps` change and invalidate the outstanding promise.
 * Callers are not required to heed this, however, as stale promises will not
 * cause rerenders.
 *
 * @param deps The array of values that are used by the operation. Value changes
 * to these will result in a new promise being created and the old one being
 * sent an abort signal.
 *
 * @returns A `RemoteData` representation of the promise's results. The hook
 * forces a rerender when the promise resolves or rejects. If `op === undefined`
 * the hook will return `RemoteData.NOT_ASKED`.
